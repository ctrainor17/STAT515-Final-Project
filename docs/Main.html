<section id="enhanced-fujita-scale" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enhanced-fujita-scale">Enhanced Fujita Scale</h3>
<p>The Enhanced Fujita Scale, or EF Scale, is used to categorize a tornado based on estimated winds speeds and the resulting damage. The National Weather Service is the authority that assigns the tornado EF Scale category based on the highest wind speeds and degrees of damage (Figure 2).</p>

<p>*Of note, not pictured in the above chart is the classification “EFU.” EFU is short for EF-Unknown for tornadoes that could not be rated due to lack of damage evidence. <a href="https://www.weather.gov/oun/efscale#fujitascale">EF Scale</a></p>

<section id="data-exploration---trends" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-exploration---trends">Data Exploration - Trends</h2>
<p>During data exploration, a few data trends became apparent and helped lead us to establishing our research question. As described above, tornadoes are classified by wind speeds and the degree of resulting damage.</p>
<section id="tornado-dimensions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tornado-dimensions">Tornado Dimensions</h3>
<p>Figure 3 is a scatter plot of tornado dimensions, length and width, categorized by tornado classification. Not surprisingly, larger tornadoes tended to merit a higher EF Scale rating. Figure 4 is a plot of tornado width and duration categorized by tornado classification. Not surprisingly, tornadoes with a wider path and a longer duration tended to merit a higher EF Scale rating.</p>

<p>While an examination of tornado dimensions helps to inform understanding of the nature of tornadoes and the EF Scale, it doesn’t help to identify at-risk communities to help them prepare for the impact of severe storms. We next explored trends by region and season for patterns that could help identify at-risk areas.</p>
</section>
<section id="region-and-season" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="region-and-season">Region and Season</h3>
<p>“Tornado season” varies by region based on climate factors. Tornadoes are most prevalent in the Midwest and Southeast United States, although they’ve been recorded in all 50 states and some territories. In Figure 5 below, “OCONUS” is short for “outside the continental United States” and includes Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories. You can see below that winter tornadoes occur mostly in the Southeast United States due to the warmer climate.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-questions-methods-and-results">Research Questions, Methods, and Results</h2>
<p>Based on our data exploration, we settled on four research questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Is there a relationship between tornado regions and the resulting intensity?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a relationship between tornado seasons and the resulting intensity?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors predict the intensity and damage?</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-relationship-between-tornado-regions-and-the-resulting-intensity">1. Is there a relationship between tornado regions and the resulting intensity?</h3>
<section id="data-exploration" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-exploration">Data Exploration</h4>
<p>First, we performed ANOVA testing to confirm that there is a difference on damage based on f-scale. The null hypothesis of this test states that the mean total damage is the same across all f-scale levels, while the alternate hypothesis states that mean total damage is not the same across all f-scale levels.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>              Df    Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)

</div>
</div>
<p>The results showed a p-value(&lt;2e-16) less than the significance level(0.05), we were able to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the total damage is different among different f-scale levels. Therefore, that f-scale indeed has an effect on the total damage caused by the tornado, and we can say that more damage is associated with higher f-scales.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>To test if there is a significant relationship between the tornado region and the total damage, a chi-squared test was performed. The The null hypothesis of this test stated that the region does not affect the intensity of the tornado (f-scale) and that the two variables are independent of each other. Meanwhile, the alternate hypothesis stated that the two variables are dependent, meaning there is a relationship between tornado F-scale and region.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>
    Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  table_region
X-squared = 287.29, df = 20, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since the p-value was &lt;2.2e-16 which is lower than the significance level 0.05, we were able to reject the null hypothesis. In addition, the x-squared value was 287.29 suggesting a strong relationship between the two variables. This means that the region does have an effect on the f-scale of the tornado, suggesting that some regions are at more risks than others.</p>
<p>In addition, an interactive map was created to show the distribution of tornadoes and their locations in the United States as well as their associated total damage and f-scale.</p>

<p>From the map, we can see that the most common location for tornadoes was southeast region of the United States of America, with a count of 326 tornadoes.</p>
<p>Next, a heat map was created to show the frequency of tornadoes in different regions of the United States based on their f-scale (Figure 6). The darker blue colors represent more frequent occurrences in the region while lighter green and blue represent lower or even no occurrences at all.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph, tornadoes with EF0 were most frequent in the Midwest, while tornadoes with a level of EF1 were occurring more frequently in the southeastern part of the United States. Moreover, we can see that the northeastern and western regions experienced the least amount of tornadoes of all levels.</p>
<p>Another way to visualize the frequency of tornadoes in regions and their intensity was through a grouped bar graph as shown in Figure 7.</p>

<p>The bar chart confirms that the highest count of tornadoes was in the southeastern region of the States, while the least amount of tornadoes occurred in west of America. Particularly, the least amount of tornadoes was the EF4 scale in the west region. On the other hand,the most common tornadoes were the EF1 scale tornadoes in the southeastern region, putting the southeastern region at more risks.</p>

<p>First, the analysis confirmed that tornado intensity (EF-scale) has a significant impact on total damage, with higher-intensity tornadoes generally causing more destruction. The Chi-Square test showed a strong relationship between tornado region and F-scale, revealing that certain regions are more likely to experience specific tornado intensities. Moreover, both the heat map and bar chart highlighted that the southeastern region had the highest frequency of tornadoes, particularly EF1 scale, putting this region at greater risk. In contrast, the west region experienced the fewest tornadoes, especially at higher intensities like EF4.</p>

<p>To explore the relationship between the season and EF Scale rating, we first used chi squared tests to determine if a relationship existed. The null hypothesis was that there was no relationship, and the alternate hypothesis that a relationship did exist between the season and EF Scale rating.</p>
<p>The chi squared test yielded a p-value less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>Next we explored the relationship between two other measures of tornado effects: total damage in $ and total casualties, or the total number of people injured or killed during a tornado. Since these outcome variables are quantitative numeric variables, we used ANOVA testing. The null hypothesis was that there was no relationship, and the alternate hypothesis that a relationship did exist.</p>

<p>From hypothesis testing, we conclude that there is a significant relationship between the predictor variable season and the outcome variable EF Scale rating.

<p>This code implements an XGBoost regression model to predict total tornado damage (TOTAL_DAMAGE) using temporal, physical, and geographic features, with model performance evaluated using RMSE and feature importance. An XGBoost classification model classifies tornadoes as high-damage (HIGH_DAMAGE), evaluated via a confusion matrix. Additionally, an interactive leaflet map visualizes tornado locations, damage levels, intensity, and seasonal patterns.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Dataset Preparation</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly, we cleaned the dataset by selecting relevant columns, transforming damage values into numeric format, and handling missing values by replacing them with column means. Additionally, we engineered new features, such as total damage (<code>TOTAL_DAMAGE</code>), log-transformed damage (<code>LOG_TOTAL_DAMAGE</code>), and tornado area (<code>TOR_AREA</code>).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Class Balancing</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>To address the imbalance in the high-damage (<code>HIGH_DAMAGE</code>) classification target, we oversampled the minority class using the ROSE library, creating a balanced dataset for training and testing.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Damage Prediction (Regression)</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>We trained an XGBoost regression model to predict total damage (<code>TOTAL_DAMAGE</code>) based on temporal, physical, and geographic features. The model was evaluated using RMSE and RMSE as a percentage of the mean damage, with feature importance analyzed to identify key predictors.</p>

<p>The model indicates that the XGBoost regression model effectively predicts total tornado damage, with an RMSE representing a percentage of the mean damage. Key predictors include tornado length, width, and area, with geographic and temporal features also contributing. Additionally, the XGBoost classification model accurately identifies high-damage events, as validated by the confusion matrix.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Tornadoes are a weather phenomena that affect many communities every year. Our research found that season and region do influence tornado intensity. In particular, the southeastern regions experienced the most tornadoes, and almost all regions had more tornadoes in the summer and spring seasons. Nonetheless, it is hard to predict tornado intensity without also considering tornado dimensions and resulting damage, therefore that was our limitation. Future research could explore alternative measures of region and season to prepare vulnerable communities for significant tornado events.</p>
