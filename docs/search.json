    "text": "Data Exploration - Trends\nDuring data exploration, a few data trends became apparent and helped lead us to establishing our research question. As described above, tornadoes are classified by wind speeds and the degree of resulting damage.\n\nTornado Dimensions\nFigure 3 is a scatter plot of tornado dimensions, length and width, categorized by tornado classification. Larger tornadoes tended to merit a higher EF Scale rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion and Season\n“Tornado season” varies by region based on climate factors. Tornadoes are most prevalent in the Midwest and Southeast United States, although they’ve been recorded in all 50 states and some territories. In Figure 4 below, “OCONUS” is short for “outside the continental United States” and includes Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories. You can see below that winter tornadoes occur mostly in the Southeast United States due to the warmer climate."
