    "text": "Data Exploration - Trends\nDuring data exploration, a few data trends became apparent and helped lead us to establishing our research question. As described above, tornadoes are classified by wind speeds and the degree of resulting damage.\n\nTornado Dimensions\nFigure 3 is a scatter plot of tornado dimensions, length and width, categorized by tornado classification. Not surprisingly, larger tornadoes tended to merit a higher EF Scale rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 is a plot of tornado width and duration categorized by tornado classification. Not surprisingly, tornadoes with a wider path and a longer duration tended to merit a higher EF Scale rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile an examination of tornado dimensions helps to inform understanding of the nature of tornadoes and the EF Scale, it doesn’t help to identify at-risk communities to help them prepare for the impact of severe storms. We next explored trends by region and season for patterns that could help identify at-risk areas.\n\n\nRegion and Season\n“Tornado season” varies by region based on climate factors. Tornadoes are most prevalent in the Midwest and Southeast United States, although they’ve been recorded in all 50 states and some territories. In Figure 4 below, “OCONUS” is short for “outside the continental United States” and includes Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories. You can see below that winter tornadoes occur mostly in the Southeast United States due to the warmer climate."

    "text": "Research Questions, Methods, and Results\nBased on our data exploration, we settled on four research questions:\n\nIs there a relationship between tornado regions and the resulting intensity?\nIs there a relationship between tornado seasons and the resulting intensity?\nWhat factors predict the intensity and damage?\n\n\n1. Is there a relationship between tornado regions and the resulting intensity?\n\nData Exploration\nAdd an introduction and any summary visualizations you used to begin your analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nDescribe the analysis techniques that you employed (variable selection, classification, regression, etc)\n\n\nResults\nDescribe your results, significance, and add any visualizations from your modeling.\n\n\n\n2. Is there a relationship between tornado seasons and the resulting intensity?\n\nData Exploration\nA preliminary examination of the data shows that tornadoes occur most frequently in the spring and summer months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nTo explore the relationship between the season and EF Scale rating, we first used chi squared tests to determine if a relationship existed. The null hypothesis was that there was no relationship, and the alternate hypothesis that a relationship did exist between the season and EF Scale rating.\nThe chi squared test yielded a p-value less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n        \n         EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4\n  Spring 100 197 224  76  28   2\n  Summer 144 192 172  35   8   0\n  Fall    15  44  18   3   0   0\n  Winter  12  82 110  54   7   0\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  hyp_table\nX-squared = 121.87, df = 15, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nNext we explored the relationship between two other measures of tornado effects: total damage in $ and total casualties, or the total number of people injured or killed during a tornado. Since these outcome variables are quantitative numeric variables, we used ANOVA testing. The null hypothesis was that there was no relationship, and the alternate hypothesis that a relationship did exist.\n\n\n              Df    Sum Sq   Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)  \nSEASON         3 1.336e+11 4.454e+10   2.497 0.0582 .\nResiduals   1460 2.604e+13 1.784e+10                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n59 observations deleted due to missingness\n\n\nANOVA testing of the season and total damage variables yielded a p-value of greater than 0.05 but less than 0.1. In other words, there is weak evidence that the total damage of a hurricane is affected by the season.\n\n\n              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)\nSEASON         3    156   52.06   1.383  0.246\nResiduals   1519  57195   37.65               \n\n\nANOVA testing of the season and casualties variables yielded a p-value of greater than 0.1, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no relationship between the variables.\n\n\nResults\nFrom hypothesis testing, we conclude that there is a significant relationship between the predictor variable season and the outcome variable EF Scale rating. Hypothesis testing also indicates a weak relationship between the predictor variable season and the outcome variable total damage, however there is not a relationship to the outcome variable casualties.\n\n\n\n3. What factors predict the intensity and damage?\nHaving examined these relationships, is it possible to model tornado intensity and damage?\n\nData Exploration\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nResults"
